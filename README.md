# excel_data_analyst

<b>Description</b>: As a Data Analyst, I analyzed employee salaries across departments and regions using advanced MS Excel. I applied statistical functions like AVERAGE, MEDIAN, MIN, MAX, and SUM to summarize the data and used VLOOKUP, XLOOKUP, and HLOOKUP to retrieve key information. I calculated annual bonuses by department and country, and utilized Pivot Tables and Slicers to highlight Top and Bottom Salaries. Conditional Formatting was used to visually emphasize key insights, enabling more informed decision-making for management.
